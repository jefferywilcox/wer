Get Points On Zombies In The First 3 Rounds or Less. If you want a lot of points, you have to do this on the 1st round: shoot 4 times a the zombies then stab. If they are on fire, shoot 3 times then stab, and on the 2nd round shoot 5 times then stab, and again if they are on fire shoot one less time then stab. Deadshot Daquiri perk in Zombies mode. In Zombies mode, get a collateral head shot with a single bullet to permanently unlock the Deadshot Daquiri perk in Zombies mode. This perk increases the head shot multiplier. Quick Revive perk in Zombies mode. In Zombies mode, revive the same teammate at least fifteen times in the same round.
